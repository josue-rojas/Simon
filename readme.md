#Simon Says for Android

#####Description
A copy of the game simon says. The computer gives a pattern for the user to match it adds more to the pattern until the player cannot remember anymore and presses the wrong button casuing them to lose. This project was done for CS Applied Science by [Josue](https://github.com/josuerojasrojas), [Edgar](https://github.com/edmorales94), and [Junior](https://github.com/Ultimate867). The goal was to use different data structures to be implemented in an app. We used HashMaps and ArrayList to act as queues.
