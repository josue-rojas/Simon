#Simon Says for Android

#####Description
A copy of the game simon says. The computer gives a pattern for the user to match then it adds more to the pattern until the player cannot remember anymore and presses the wrong button causing them to lose. This project was done for CS Applied Science by [Josue](https://github.com/josuerojasrojas), [Edgar](https://github.com/edmorales94), and [Junior](https://github.com/Ultimate867). The goal was to implement different data structures in an Android app, in this case a Simon says game. Data structures we used were HashMaps and ArrayList and our version of queues.
